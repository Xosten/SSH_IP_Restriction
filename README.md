# SSH IP Restrictor
This simple script helps to resolve an IP from a domain or subdomain and restrict the SSH access from only that IP. If your home ISP assigns you a dynamic IP this script can be really useful. 
## Requirements
You will need to have a DynDNS setup. You can use something like NO-IP.
## Credits
This script has been shared from my VPS hosting provider, [Pulseheberg](https://pulseheberg.com). All credits goes to them.
